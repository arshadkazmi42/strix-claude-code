# Strix Penetration Testing

Run security assessments using [Strix Claude Code](https://github.com/tghastings/strix-claude-code) — an AI-powered pen testing tool that uses Claude CLI inside a Kali Linux Docker sandbox.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** running
- **Claude CLI** authenticated (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-cli && claude login`)
- **Python 3.11+**
- **screen** (`sudo apt install screen`)
- **Strix** installed: `pip install -e .` (from this repo)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tghastings/strix-claude-code.git
cd strix-claude-code
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### TUI Dashboard (recommended)
```bash
strix-claude-tui
```
Keys: `n` new scan, `a <num>` attach, `v <num>` view, `s <num>` stop, `d <num>` delete, `r` refresh, `q` quit. Detach from scan: `Ctrl+A` then `D`.

### CLI Direct
```bash
# Deep scan (default)
strix-claude-cli -t https://target.com

# Quick scan (CI/CD)
strix-claude-cli -t https://target.com -m quick

# Standard scan with focus area
strix-claude-cli -t https://target.com -m standard --instruction "Focus on authentication bypass"

# Multiple targets / whitebox
strix-claude-cli -t https://app.com -t ./source-code

# GitHub repo scan
strix-claude-cli -t https://github.com/user/repo -m deep

# Custom output path
strix-claude-cli -t https://target.com -o ~/reports/scan.md
```

### Scan Modes
- **quick** — Fast CI/CD check, critical vulns only (~5-10 min)
- **standard** — Balanced automated + targeted manual testing (~15-30 min)
- **deep** — Exhaustive: full recon, comprehensive testing, vuln chaining (~30-60+ min)

## What Happens During a Scan

1. Docker sandbox starts (Kali Linux + security tools)
2. MCP server exposes pen testing tools to Claude
3. Claude autonomously runs recon, scanning, exploitation, and reporting
4. Vulnerability report saved (default: `~/strix_report_<timestamp>.md`)

## Available Tools in Sandbox

Claude gets access to: nmap, nuclei, sqlmap, ffuf, dirsearch, subfinder, httpx, semgrep, bandit, trufflehog, zaproxy, wapiti, trivy, jwt_tool, Playwright browser, Caido HTTP proxy, and more.

See the MCP server implementation for the full tool inventory.

## OpenClaw Agent Integration

### Via coding-agent skill (recommended)
Spawn a Claude CLI agent to run Strix interactively:
```bash
# Use coding-agent skill with PTY
exec command="claude --model claude-opus-4-6" pty=true
# Then at the Claude Code prompt:
# > strix-claude-cli -t https://target.com -m deep
```

### Direct execution
For automated scans without TUI interaction:
```bash
# Background exec with PTY (required for interactive Claude CLI)
exec command="strix-claude-cli -t https://target.com -o report.md" pty=true background=true
```

**Important**: Always use `pty=true` when running Strix from OpenClaw — Claude CLI requires a TTY. Without PTY, the scan will fall back to non-interactive mode and print manual instructions instead of executing.

### Permissions Bypass for Headless Operation

The main branch includes fixes to suppress all interactive prompts (workspace trust, environment commands, file permissions):

- `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` flag
- `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_TRUST_DIALOG=1` environment variable
- Auto-approval of all file operations

This enables true headless/automated security scanning without manual intervention.

### Example: OpenClaw Agent Workflow

```python
# In an OpenClaw agent session:

# 1. Spawn a Claude Opus agent to run the scan
exec(
    command="strix-claude-cli -t https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com -m deep -o juice-shop-report.md",
    pty=True,
    background=True
)

# 2. Monitor progress
process(action="list")

# 3. When complete, share results via GitHub gist
# (use OpenClaw's message tool with GitHub API)
```

## Tips

- Use `--keep-container` to examine findings post-scan
- Point `-t` at local source code for whitebox analysis
- Reports use CVSS scoring — check for anything ≥7.0
- Use `-v` for verbose output when troubleshooting
- **GitHub gist sharing**: Create private gists for security reports (never public)
- **Claude Max limits**: Deep scans can hit rate limits; they'll pause and resume after limit resets (~5 hours)

## Example Report Output

```markdown
# Security Assessment Report

**Target:** OWASP Juice Shop v19.1.1
**Scan Mode:** Deep

## Findings

### SQL Injection in Login Endpoint
**Severity:** CRITICAL (9.8)
**CVSS:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

#### Impact
Complete authentication bypass...

#### Proof of Concept
```python
requests.post("http://target/login", json={
    "email": "' OR 1=1--",
    "password": "x"
})
```
```
